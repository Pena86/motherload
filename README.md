First version on my python / pyGame implementation of game Motherload.
The game is still very buggy, so don't expect too much.
The original game is found: http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/motherload

All graphics are from https://itch.io/game-assets
See the motherload.py source file to find the links.
Thanks to original authors
